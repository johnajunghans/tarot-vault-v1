**This is a living document of known bugs/issues to resolve in the MVP**

## Spreads
1. ~~When new spread is created, there are zero cards with an outline prompting users to double click to add new cards. But the logic remains that prevents users from deleting a card if it is the only one.~~

### Mobile
1. Can't scroll well on canvas. Specifically, cannot scoll to the bottom and access the settings button to open settings sheet.
2. ~~Sidebar avatar does not contain name on mobile.~~
