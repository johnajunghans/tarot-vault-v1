# Archiving Protocol
*Instructions for future LLMs on how to archive content in these files.*

**What "archiving" means:**
Completed build steps and change log entries accumulate detail that clutters active planning. Archiving moves the full content to `mvp-build-archive.md` and replaces it in this file with a compact one-liner, keeping this file short and scannable.

**How to archive an Entry:**
1. Copy the full entry (bold header + Summary + Future considerations block) to the top of the `# 0_Archived_Entries` section in `./mvp-build-archive.md`, converting the header format to `**MM/DD/YYYY -- {title} -- {model}**`
2. In this file, remove the full entry and add a single bullet to `## Archived Entries` in the format: `- {step or date} — {short title}`

**How to archive a Build Plan section or subsection:**
1. Copy the full spec content (the `### ~~X.X.X_Title~~` heading and all its numbered steps) to the matching `## X.X_Section (archived)` section in `# 1_Archived_Build_Plan` of `./mvp-build-archive.md`. If that archived section doesn't exist yet, create it following the existing `---` separator pattern.
2. In this file, remove the full `### ~~X.X.X~~` block and replace it with a single bullet under the parent `## ~~X.X_Section~~` stub in the format: `- **X.X.X** — {one-line description}. ~~Complete~~`
3. If the entire parent section is now just bullets (no remaining full specs), ensure the section header has the ` note.

# Build Plan
*H2 Heading crossed out (e.g. ## ~~1.2_Example~~) means that the section is complete and has been archived. H3 Headings indicate active steps (e.g. ### 1.2.1_Example); when archived they are replaced with the following format: "**1.2.1** — Example". Full steps archived in mvp-build-archive.md.*

### 1.4.5_Spreads Audit and Refactor
1. The spreads route has become potentially bogged down with LLM generated code that might be redundant, inefficient, or unmaintainable. Your primary goals are the following:
    1. Read and review all files in the spreads route (app/(app)/personal/spreads/*)
        1. Check for any major bugs that might be inhibiting performance, particularly in the spreads/canvas directory.
        2. Look for redunant code that can be distilled or completely removed to lean out the codebase.
        3. Look for ways to improve readibility and maintainability.
        4. Look for ways to restructure files and folders for better organization.
    2. Focus in on the zoom functionality and check again for any bugs. Zoom functionality feels jerky and stuttery on mobile devices (with touch pinch zoom) and generally laggy at times.
2. In general, focus on removing or replacing code rather than adding more code in. Try and finds ways of abstracting, distilling, and making the codebase more DRY. Of course, if there are bugs that need to be solved by adding code, then that is okay.
3. Start in plan mode to read and make a plan/suggestion for refactoring actions that could be taken. Prioritize biggest bang for the buck refactors (highest return for lowest refactoring effort and risk).
