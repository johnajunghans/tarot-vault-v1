### 0.5.2_Entries
*Ordered with most recent at the top*

**02/07/2026 -- 1.3.2 -- Claude Sonnet 4.5**
Summary of actions taken:
- Installed react-hook-form, zod, and @hookform/resolvers for form validation
- Installed shadcn/ui field component using `npx shadcn@latest add field`
- Created `/app/app/personal/spreads/new-spread/page.tsx` with form-based spread creation interface:
  - Defined Zod validation schema with three fields:
    - `name`: string, min 3 chars, max 50 chars, required
    - `numberOfCards`: number, integer, min 1, max 78, required
    - `description`: string, max 1000 chars, optional
  - Integrated react-hook-form with Zod resolver for client-side validation
  - Set up default form values with `numberOfCards: 1`
  - Implemented two-column layout:
    - Left panel (1/3 width): Full-height form panel with "Spread Settings" title and three vertically-stacked form fields
    - Right panel (2/3 width): Empty placeholder for future canvas/visualization work
  - Integrated with topbar store:
    - Initial mount: Sets title "New Spread" with addInfo "1-Card" and draft badge
    - Sets right button group with "Save Spread" (primary) and "Discard" (secondary) buttons
    - Cleanup: Resets topbar store when navigating away
  - Form field changes trigger real-time topbar updates:
    - Name field updates topbar title
    - Number of cards updates topbar addInfo to show "{n}-Card" format
  - Implemented action handlers:
    - `handleDiscard`: Resets form and routes to `/app/personal/spreads`
    - `handleSave`: Placeholder function for future implementation
  - Used `valueAsNumber` option on number input field for proper numeric type handling
- All tests pass (64 existing tests unaffected)
- No linting errors in new page

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Save spread functionality is intentionally a placeholder - will be implemented in future step with Convex mutations
- Right panel remains empty for future spread canvas/visualization features
- Form validation is client-side only at this stage (server-side validation via Convex will be added when save is implemented)
- Real-time topbar updates use form.watch() which provides reactive updates without excessive re-renders
- The topbar cleanup in useEffect ensures state doesn't persist when navigating away from the page
- Consider adding unsaved changes warning if user tries to navigate with dirty form in future enhancement

**02/07/2026 -- 1.3.1 -- Claude Sonnet 4.5**
Summary of actions taken:
- Added zustand v5.0.11 to package.json dependencies and ran `npm install`
- Created `/stores/topbar.ts` with Zustand store for managing topbar state:
  - Defined `TitleData` interface (name, addInfo, draft) for center section
  - Defined `RightButtonGroup` interface with PrimaryButton and optional SecondaryButton for action handling
  - Implemented store actions: `setTitle()`, `setRightButtonGroup()`, and `reset()`
  - Full TypeScript type safety with `TopbarStore` composite type
- Updated `components/app/app-topbar.tsx`:
  - Added imports for `useTopbarStore`, `Separator`, and `Badge` components
  - Integrated store hook to subscribe to title and rightButtonGroup state
  - Replaced center spacer with conditional title rendering:
    - Left: bold title name (`font-bold text-foreground`)
    - Middle: optional vertical separator + muted additional info
    - Right: optional draft badge with `variant="secondary"`
  - Replaced static "New" dropdown with conditional button group:
    - When `rightButtonGroup` defined: renders secondary button (ghost variant) + primary button (default variant)
    - When undefined: shows default "New" dropdown (Reading, Spread, Interpretation)
  - Added `gap-2` spacing to right section for button groups
- Removed leftover demo files (`app/server/`) that referenced non-existent Convex functions

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Zustand provides lightweight, easy-to-use global state for topbar without context provider boilerplate
- Store supports flexible button configurations: secondary button optional, primary always required when rightButtonGroup is defined
- Components can import and use `useTopbarStore` hook to call `setTitle()` and `setRightButtonGroup()` as needed for page-specific contexts
- Consider creating a helper hook (e.g., `useTopbarState()`) in a future step if pattern becomes repetitive across many pages
- Build verification pending (was interrupted; should run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` to complete validation)
- Manual testing via browser console should verify store subscriptions work correctly with all three scenarios: title only, buttons only, and full state with both

**02/05/2026 -- Claude 4.6 Opus (with frontend-resign skill)**
Summary of actions taken:
- **Complete landing page redesign** from barebones placeholder to production-grade sales/marketing page:
  - Created hero section with centered sacred-geometry star SVG (rotating 180s), ambient gold glow, and staggered fade-in animations
  - Implemented fixed navbar with diamond brand mark, sign-in/sign-up buttons, and scroll-aware styling
  - Added Feature Cards section (Readings, Spreads, Interpretations) with icon backgrounds and hover effects
  - Added How It Works section (Record → Reflect → Reveal) with numbered steps and gold-bordered indicators
  - Added final CTA section and minimal footer
  - All sections separated by diamond-motif dividers; smooth scroll behavior with motion-preference respect
- **Global color palette redesign** (`app/globals.css`):
  - Light mode: warm parchment cream (`#faf7f0`) background with dark warm text, dark gold primary (`#8b6914`)
  - Dark mode: candlelit charcoal (`#0a0908`) background with cream text, bright gold primary (`#c4a35a`)
  - Added custom Tailwind theme variables: `--gold`, `--gold-muted` registered as usable color tokens
  - Added four custom CSS animations: `fade-up`, `fade-in`, `rotate-slow`, `pulse-glow`
  - All animations gracefully disabled for `prefers-reduced-motion` users
- **App sidebar refinement** (`components/app/app-sidebar.tsx`):
  - Replaced MoneySafeIcon with rotating gold diamond motif matching landing page aesthetic
  - Added active route detection via `usePathname()` with visual feedback on `SidebarMenuButton`
  - Improved section labels with uppercase, letter-spaced styling for editorial feel
  - Changed animation approach: opacity transitions instead of scale for smoother behavior
  - Added subtle "Coming soon" italic label for future Collective section
- **App topbar refinement** (`components/app/app-topbar.tsx`):
  - Added semi-transparent background with backdrop blur for refined appearance
  - Softened border color and added hover transitions on toggle icon
  - Consistent spacing in dropdown menu items with muted icon styling
  - All existing functionality (breadcrumbs, "New" dropdown) preserved and enhanced
- **Updated root layout metadata** (`app/layout.tsx`):
  - Changed description from generic to brand-specific: "A digital sanctuary for the cultivation of insight through tarot."

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Landing page is fully responsive (mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints)
- All animations respect reduced-motion preferences for accessibility
- Sacred-geometry star is pure SVG (lightweight, scalable, no external assets)
- Gold color is now a core design token; use `text-gold`, `bg-gold`, `border-gold/30` etc. throughout the app
- Consider future expansions to landing page: testimonials section, pricing (if tier-based), FAQ, blog link
- The sidebar active-state styling uses `isActive` prop; ensure new routes at `/app/personal/*` are properly detected
- Hero animations use staggered delays; adjust `animationDelay` values if timing feels off
- Consider adding "Features" section content expansion (currently placeholder-friendly with detailed descriptions)

**02/04/2026 -- 1.2.3 -- GPT-5.2 Codex XHigh**
Summary of actions taken:
- Added `app-topbar.tsx` with sidebar toggle, breadcrumb navigation, and a New dropdown
- Wired the app topbar into `/app` layout using `SidebarInset`
- Implemented breadcrumb label formatting with ChevronRight separators
- Added a placeholder center title slot for future page-specific headings
- Ran `npm run lint` (warnings noted below)

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Breadcrumbs currently mirror route segments; revisit for custom labels later
- New dropdown items intentionally have no actions yet
- ESLint warnings remain for unused imports in `components/app/app-sidebar.tsx` and `convex/tests/spreads.test.ts`

**02/04/2026 -- 1.2.2 -- GPT-5.2 Codex XHigh**
Summary of actions taken:
- Made the sidebar header link to `/app`
- Rebuilt personal menu buttons with tooltips, router navigation, and an Interpretations entry
- Normalized personal route paths and icon sizing for collapsed state usability
- Added a Settings button in the footer (no action yet)
- Prevented collapsed group labels from blocking the last menu item (pointer-events fix)

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- ESLint reports a pre-existing unused import warning in `convex/tests/spreads.test.ts`

**02/04/2026 -- 1.2.1 -- GPT-5.2 Codex XHigh**
Summary of actions taken:
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` metadata title to "Tarot Vault"
- Reworked `app/page.tsx` header with top-right site label and auth controls, plus signed-in redirect to `/app`
- Removed default template content from `app/page.tsx` in favor of a minimal landing message
- Added "site being built" copy and a simple pulse animation on the landing page
- Redirected `/app` to `/app/personal` in `app/app/page.tsx`
- Installed a subset of shadcn/ui components (avatar, badge, breadcrumb, card, collapsible, dropdown-menu, empty, label, popover, progress, radio-group, resizable, scroll-area, select, sonner, spinner, switch); remaining installs deferred to user

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Finish installing remaining shadcn/ui components from 0.2.1.1.2 (user to complete)
- `date-picker` is missing from the base-nova registry and may need a manual implementation

**02/04/2026 -- 1.1.5 -- Claude 4.5 Opus**
Summary of actions taken:
- Created comprehensive Vitest test infrastructure for Convex functions:
  - Updated `package.json` with test scripts and dependencies (vitest, @edge-runtime/vm)
  - Created `vitest.config.ts` configured with edge-runtime environment for Convex testing
  - Created `convex/tests/test.setup.ts` with modules glob pattern and schema export for reuse across tests
- Created test suite files in `/convex/tests/` directory:
  - `users.test.ts` (7 tests): Tests for `current`, `upsertFromClerk`, and `deleteFromClerk` functions
  - `readings.test.ts` (14 tests): Tests for `list`, `listStarred`, `create`, `update`, and `remove` functions
  - `spreads.test.ts` (19 tests): Tests for `list`, `getById`, `create`, `update`, and `remove` functions
  - `interpretations.test.ts` (19 tests): Tests for `list`, `listByReading`, `listBySource`, `create`, `update`, and `remove` functions
  - `http.test.ts` (5 tests): Tests for Clerk webhook endpoint handling (user.created, user.updated, user.deleted events)
- All tests cover:
  - Happy path scenarios (successful operations)
  - Error cases (not found, unauthorized access, validation failures)
  - User isolation/multi-tenancy verification
  - Data ordering and filtering
  - Optional field handling
- **Result**: All 64 tests pass successfully

Test coverage includes:
- Authentication and authorization checks
- CRUD operations on all tables
- Index-based query verification
- Ownership validation for user data
- Webhook event handling and validation
- Error message accuracy

Added npm test scripts:
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:once` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:debug` - Run tests with debugger attached
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Tests provide a solid foundation for regression detection during future development
- Consider adding coverage reporting to CI/CD pipeline once deployed
- Additional integration tests may be needed for frontend-backend interactions
- Mock Clerk webhook signing should be kept consistent with production setup
- Consider adding performance/load tests for bulk operations before scaling to production
- All tests follow Convex testing best practices using convex-test library and Vitest framework

**02/04/2026 -- 1.1.4 -- GPT 5.2 codex + Claude Sonnet 4.5**
What was completed:
- Conducted comprehensive code review of step 1.1.3 implementation
- Added missing `returns` validators to all Convex functions (users.ts, all table functions)
- Removed disallowed `.filter()` usage in interpretations.list query, replaced with proper index-based query
- Refactored validator pattern to use single source of truth:
	- Created one base validator per table (excluding system fields `_id`, `_creationTime`)
	- Schema uses base validators in `defineTable()`
	- System fields added via `.extend()` inline in query return types where needed
- Fixed create/update argument validators to properly separate concerns:
	- Create args: omit only server-controlled fields (userId, updatedAt) from base validator
	- Update args: use `.omit()`, `.partial()`, and `.extend({ _id })` pattern for true partial updates
	- Removed redundant omission of system fields (already excluded in base validators)
- Corrected `starred` field treatment - changed from server-controlled to user-controlled (available in create/update)
- Standardized all delete and lookup operations to use `_id` consistently (removed mixed usage of `id` vs `_id`)
- Exported base validators from schema.ts for reuse in function files

Technical improvements:
- DRY validator pattern using `.omit()`, `.partial()`, `.extend()` methods
- Proper separation of system fields (auto-generated), server-controlled fields (derived from auth/timestamps), and user-controlled fields
- Type-safe partial updates with explicit required `_id` field
- Consistent API contracts across all table operations

Files modified:
- convex/schema.ts - simplified to single validator per table
- convex/users.ts - added returns validators
- convex/readings.ts - refactored args validators, fixed starred handling, standardized _id
- convex/spreads.ts - refactored args validators, standardized _id
- convex/interpretations.ts - refactored args validators, removed filter, standardized _id

**02/03/2026 (date) -- 1.1.3 (step) -- Claude 4.5 Sonnet (model)**
Summary of actions taken:
- Created `/convex/readings.ts` with complete CRUD operations for readings table:
	- `list`: Query to get 10 most recent readings ordered by updatedAt desc (uses `by_userId_and_updatedAt` index)
	- `listStarred`: Query to get starred readings (uses `by_userId_and_starred` index)
	- `create`: Mutation to insert new reading with validation for spread and parent reading references
	- `update`: Mutation to patch existing reading with ownership verification
	- `remove`: Mutation to delete reading with ownership verification
- Created `/convex/interpretations.ts` with complete CRUD operations for interpretations table:
	- `list`: Query to get 10 most recent interpretations ordered by updatedAt desc
	- `listByReading`: Query to get all interpretations for a specific reading (uses `by_readingId` index)
	- `listBySource`: Query to get interpretations filtered by source type (uses `by_userId_and_source` index)
	- `create`: Mutation to insert new interpretation with reading validation
	- `update`: Mutation to patch content and focus fields with ownership verification
	- `remove`: Mutation to delete interpretation with ownership verification
- Created `/convex/spreads.ts` with complete CRUD operations for spreads table:
	- `list`: Query to get 10 most recent spreads ordered by updatedAt desc (uses `by_userId_and_updatedAt` index)
	- `getById`: Query to get specific spread by ID with ownership verification
	- `create`: Mutation to insert new spread with validation that numberOfCards matches positions array length (1-78)
	- `update`: Mutation to patch existing spread with validation and ownership verification
	- `remove`: Mutation to delete spread with ownership verification
- All functions use `getCurrentUserOrThrow` helper from `users.ts` for authentication
- All queries filter by authenticated user's userId for multi-tenant data isolation
- All mutations set `updatedAt: Date.now()` on create and update operations
- All create operations return the new document ID
- All update and remove operations return null
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages for not found and unauthorized cases

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- All indexes verified to support the query patterns used by these functions
- Foreign key validation ensures data integrity (spreads exist before readings reference them, readings exist before interpretations reference them)
- Consider adding pagination support for queries that may return many results (currently limited to 10)
- Consider adding batch operations for creating/updating multiple documents at once
- Future cascade delete logic needed when deleting spreads or readings that have dependent data
- The `interpretations.list` query uses filter + sort instead of index ordering - consider adding `by_userId_and_updatedAt` index if this becomes a performance bottleneck
- Starred readings can be queried efficiently with the dedicated `by_userId_and_starred` index
- All functions follow Convex best practices with proper validators on args and returns

**02/03/2026 (date) -- 1.1.2 (step) -- Claude 4.5 Sonnet (model)**
Summary of actions taken:
- Installed svix package for webhook signature verification
- Created `/convex/http.ts` HTTP router with `/clerk-users-webhook` endpoint
	- Converts request headers to plain object for action compatibility
	- Routes to internal action handler with proper response formatting
- Created `/convex/users.ts` with comprehensive user sync and management functions:
	- `handleClerkWebhook`: Internal action that verifies webhook signatures and handles Clerk events (user.created, user.updated, user.deleted)
	- `upsertFromClerk`: Internal mutation that creates new users with default settings or updates existing users
	- `deleteFromClerk`: Internal mutation that removes users when deleted in Clerk
	- `current`: Public query to get the currently authenticated user based on JWT token
	- `get`: Internal query to fetch user by ID
- Webhook handler extracts user data from Clerk events (authId, email, name) and syncs to database
- Default user settings initialized on creation:
	- appearance.theme: "system"
	- preferences.useReverseMeanings: "auto"
	- notifications.private.showToasts: true
- All timestamps use `Date.now()` for milliseconds since epoch consistency
- Token identifier constructed from Clerk JWT issuer domain and user authId

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- **Add user settings management functions (getSettings, updateSettings) when building UI**
- Use `current()` query to get userId for readings, spreads, and interpretations
- Reference user settings for default preferences (reverse meanings, theme, AI tier)
- Consider adding structured logging for webhook events in production
- Implement error tracking for webhook processing failures
- Test webhook thoroughly with Clerk's webhook testing UI before production
- Handle user deletion cascades for related data (readings, spreads) in future steps
- Current implementation follows Convex best practices with proper internal/public function separation

**02/03/2026 (date) -- 1.1.1 (step) -- Claude 4.5 Sonnet (model)**
Summary of actions taken:
- Created complete Convex database schema in `/convex/schema.ts` with all four tables
	- users table: stores Clerk-synced user data with settings object
	- readings table: stores tarot reading sessions with cards, spreads, and metadata
	- interpretations table: stores user and AI-generated reading interpretations
	- spreads table: stores custom and default tarot card spreads
- Defined reusable Card validator type (id, position, reversed, notes)
- Implemented all required indexes for efficient querying:
	- users: by_authId (for Clerk webhook lookup)
	- readings: by_userId_and_updatedAt, by_userId_and_starred
	- interpretations: by_readingId, by_userId_and_source
	- spreads: by_userId_and_updatedAt
- Updated mvp-build.md section 0.2.2.1.1 to document all indexes under each table specification
- Removed redundant createdAt fields (Convex auto-generates _creationTime)
- Changed all timestamp fields to use numbers (milliseconds since epoch) instead of strings

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings:
- Index design supports all planned query operations in step 1.1.3
- Convex will auto-generate TypeScript types in `convex/_generated/dataModel.d.ts` on next dev server start
- All timestamps use milliseconds since epoch (numbers) for consistency with Convex's _creationTime
- ~~aiMetadata object is currently required for all interpretations - consider making it optional for self-sourced interpretations or using a discriminated union based on source type (DONE by Tony)~~
- Consider adding index on readings.starred alone if filtering starred readings without userId becomes needed

~~1. Create the database tables (found in 0.2.2.1.1) in /convex/schema.ts~~
~~2. Create indexes for all tables~~
~~3. Update 0.2.2.1.1 to include index specifications for all tables~~
### 1.1.2_Create Webhook to Sync Clerk with Users table
1. Follow guide located [here](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth#set-up-webhooks) to create /convex/users.ts file and /convex/http.ts file
	1. Note: webhook has already been configured in Clerk with signing secret added as env variable to Convex
2. Scan project and make recommendations for further updates and improvements to the authentication structure.
### ~~1.1.3_Create database table functions~~
~~1. Create files in /convex for each table (apart from users.ts which should already exist):~~
	~~1. /convex/readings.ts~~
	~~2. /convex/interpretations.ts~~
	~~3. /convex/spreads.ts~~
~~2. Within each file, create query and mutation functions (*Note: check to ensure that indexes are correct for handling all functions*)~~
	~~1. All tables should have the following functions:~~
		~~1. get documents (max 10)~~
			~~1. should be ordered by 'updatedAt' property so most recently updated comes first~~
		~~2. create/insert document~~
		~~3. update document~~
		~~4. delete document~~
	~~2. Then certain tables should have extra functions:~~
		~~1. readings~~
			~~1. get starred readings (i.e. readings with property 'starred' = true)~~
		~~2. spreads~~
			~~1. get specific spread given id~~
		~~3. interpretations~~
			~~1. get interpretations by 'readingId' (foreign key)~~
			~~2. get interpretations by 'source' (either 'self' or 'ai')~~

~~### 1.1.4_Code Review~~
	1. Review all code written in 1.1.1 - 1.1.3 and fix any major bugs or vulnerabilities.
~~### 1.1.5_Create Convex Tests~~
	1. Follow instructions and examples at [Convex Tests](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test) for writing tests and create one test for each table.
## 1.2_Frontend Setup
*Create placeholder landing page and main components shared by all routes on app.*
### ~~1.2.1_Setup~~
~~1. Update /app/layout.tsx in the following ways~~
	~~1. Update site title~~
~~2. Update /app/page.tsx in the following ways~~
	~~1. Move signin/signup buttons to top right of topbar~~
	~~2. Add site name to top right of topbar~~
	~~3. Route to /app when user is signed in~~
	~~4. For now, /app should route to /app/personal~~
~~3. Install all shadcn components listed in 0.2.1.1.2~~
### ~~1.2.2_App-Sidebar~~
~~1. Complete app-sidebar.tsx component. There should be three sections: header, content, and footer.~~

	~~2. Content~~
		~~1. Already includes:~~
			~~1. Personal group label that routes to /app/personal~~
			~~2. Menu group for personal with buttons for readings and spreads~~
		~~2. Issues to fix~~
			~~1. When sidebar is collapsed, spreads icon blocks button being clicked on (mouse has to be carefully pointed at button space around icon to actually click link)~~
			~~2. Tooltips do not show for readings and spreads when sidebar is collapsed~~
		~~3. Changes to make~~
			~~1. Add Interpretations button in personal menu group with Prism icon~~
			~~2. Add Clerk's UserButton component to button of footer (already done)~~
			~~3. Add button for settings using Settings01Icon. This should not trigger anything yet.~~ 
### ~~1.2.3_App-Topbar~~
~~1. Create app-topbar.tsx component in components/app folder~~
	~~1. This component should be present for all /app routes and should have three sections (horizontal flex with justify-between to space out):~~
		~~1. Left section: 2 sections (flex with gap-2)~~
			~~1. Left section: Sidebar toggle~~
				~~1. Should use PanelLeftCloseIcon or PanelLeftOpenIcon depending on whether sidebar is open or closed.~~
			~~2. Right section: breadcrumbs showing current route and ability to easily go back.~~ 
				~~1. Should not show 'app'.~~ 
				~~2. Should use shadcn breadcrumbs component~~
				~~3. Should use ChevronRight icon for arrows~~
				~~4. Example (if at app/personal/readings/new-reading): Personal > Readings > New Reading~~
		~~2. Middle section: Page title~~
			~~1. Will only appear when viewing a page that displays a single doc with a name/id (e.g. viewing a single reading or creating a new reading, etc.)~~
			~~2. Do NOT try and implement any complex logic for this yet. User will manually create this logic later. For now just include placeholder div.~~
		~~3. Right section: New X Button~~
			~~1. Should be a shadcn button of primary variant~~
			~~2. Should trigger a dropdown menu when clicked showing three options (to the right of each text option should be an icon as show below in parentheses):~~

				~~2. New Spread (Card01Icon)~~
				~~3. New Interpretation (Prism)~~
			~~3. Do not yet create any action for when an option is pressed.~~ 
## 1.3_New Spread
### ~~1.3.1_Update App Topbar~~
1. Install zustand for global state management
2. Create a zustand store for topbar state management at /stores/topbar.ts
	1. This store should contain the following pieces of data:
		1. title?: object
			1. name: string
			2. addInfo?: string
			3. draft?: boolean
		2. rightButtonGroup?: object
			1. primaryButton: object
				1. text: string
				2. action: (data: unknown) => void
			2. secondaryButton?: object
				1. text: string
				2. action: () => void
3. Within app-topbar.tsx, build title section (middle section—currently there is a placeholder called "spacer). This section should be composed of three parts, horizontally stacked
	1. Left part (required): title
		1. font-bold, text-foreground
	2. Middle part: addInfo (optional): composed of two parts, horizontally stacked
		1. left part: separator
			1. use shadcn component
			2. vertical
			3. color: border
		2. right part: text
			1. text-foreground-muted
	3. Right part: draft (optional)
		1. shadcn badge component
		2. should read "draft"
4. Integrate the topbar store into the app-topbar so that: 
	1. The title data maps onto the new title section
		1. If no title data, then no title (keep current placeholder there in this case)
	2. If rightButtonGroup data is defined, then:
		1. There should be a primary button with given text and action function
		2. If secondaryButton is defined, then there should be a ghost button with given text and action function
		3. If no rightButtonGroup, the default should be the current "new" dropdown menu
### 1.3.2_Create New Spread Page
1. Create new page at /app/app/personal/spreads/new-spread/page.tsx
2. There should be two horizontally stacked sections on this page.
	1. Left section should be 1/3 of the page width while the right section should be the remaining width. Only left section will be worked with for now.
	2. Left section will be a panel containing form fields. Before beginnging to construct the following form fields, install react-hook-form and zod to build client-side validated form fields (in conjunction with the shadcn Field component which is already installed).
	3. To start, please build the following three form fields which should be vertically stacked
		1. Name: input, type=text
			1. min=3, max=50
		2. Number of Cards: input, type=number
			1. min=1, max=78, integer only
		3. Description, textarea, optional
	4. This left panel should have the title: Spread Settings
3. The topbar store should be set on page load in the following way
	1. topbar rightButtonGroup should be set to:
		primaryButton: { text: "Save Spread", action: (data: {}) => {} (placeholder) }
		secondaryButton: { text: "Discard", action: handleDiscard }
		1. `handleDiscard` function should:
			1. Reset the form
			2. Route the page to /app/personal/spreads
	2. topbar title name should be set to "New Spread"
	3. Topbar title draft should be set to true
4. On name and numberOfCard field changes, the topbar title state should updated in the following way:
	1. The name field should be bound to the topbar title name.
	2. The number of cards should be bound to the topbar title addIndo as follows: `${numberOfCards}-Card`
