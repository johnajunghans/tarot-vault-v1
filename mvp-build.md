### 0.5.2_Entries
*Ordered with most recent at the top*

**02/17 — Step 1.3.10 — New Spread Responsive Design** | Model: Claude Opus 4.6

Summary
- Added `truncate max-w-[120px] md:max-w-[200px]` to spread title in panel-wrapper topbar to prevent long titles pushing buttons off-screen
- Added `min-w-0` to centerTitle flex containers in `app-topbar.tsx` to allow flex children to shrink
- Extracted `SpreadSettingsContent` and `CardSettingsContent` as reusable content components from their panel wrappers
- Lifted `addCard` callback from spread-settings-panel up to panel-wrapper for shared use
- On mobile (`isMobile`), replaced ResizablePanelGroup with: floating toolbar (settings + add card buttons), full-width SpreadCanvas, left Sheet for spread settings, right Sheet for card settings
- Sheets positioned below topbar with `!top-[57px] !h-[calc(100vh-57px)]` to avoid overlaying topbar
- `handleSave` onInvalid opens spread settings sheet on mobile instead of expanding panel
- Desktop layout unchanged (ResizablePanelGroup with collapsible panels)
- Removed unused `useIsMobile` import from `app-topbar.tsx`
- All 64 existing tests pass; no new lint errors

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings
- Sheet overlay covers full viewport (standard UX); only sheet content is constrained below topbar
- Topbar height (57px) is hardcoded — if topbar height changes, sheet positioning needs updating
- Card settings sheet auto-opens when a card is selected and auto-closes on deselect via `selectedCardIndex !== null`

**02/14 — Step 1.4.1 — Spreads Page** | Model: Claude Opus 4.6

Summary
- Created `spread-card.tsx` — reusable card component with name, date, and optional DRAFT badge using shadcn Card/Badge
- Updated `page.tsx` — client component that loads saved spreads via `useQuery(api.tables.spreads.list)` and draft spreads from localStorage (`spread-draft-*` keys)
- Responsive grid layout (`sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) with loading spinner, empty state, and conditional Drafts section
- All 64 existing tests pass (no backend changes)

Future considerations/recommendations/warnings
- Click handlers on SpreadCard (navigate to edit/view) deferred to a future step
- Draft cleanup (deleting stale drafts, resuming drafts) not yet implemented
- May want to add a "New Spread" button/CTA on the empty state

### 1.3.10_New Spread Responsive Design
1. For all screen widths, new spread title in topbar should be truncated with ellipses so that it does encroach on surrounding elements. For example, in mobile view, as the user types in their spread title, the corresponding string in the topbar should truncate at a certain width such that the right hand button group is not pushed off to the side. 
2. Both spread settings panel and card settings panel should turn into sheets (shadcn sheet components) at mobile viewports.
	1. Use the useIsMobile hook to dynamically determine mobile viewports.
	2. At mobile viewports, the spread settings panel should always be hidden with a button called "spread settings" and a small plus icon button for adding a new card. When the spread settings button is pressed, then the spread settings form should show as a sheet (i.e. it should overlay the canvas rather than displacing it like the panel does). 
	3. Similarly, at mobile viewports, selecting a card (i.e. setSelectedIndex !== null) should open up a sheet rather than the panel. 
	4. Importantly, these two sheets should NOT overlay the topbar (i.e. the whole height the screen). Instead, their height should be the same as the panel that they replace at mobile viewports. So, the only difference between the panel and the sheet is that the sheet will overlay the canvas while the panel displaces the canvas. 
	5. See components/ui/sidebar.tsx for an example of how the useIsMobile hook is used to conditionally render a sheet at mobile viewports. However, again, the height of these spread settings and card settings sheets should NOT be the whole height of the screen but instead should just conver the canvas, NOT the app-topbar.

## 1.4_View/Edit Spreads
### ~~1.4.1_Spreads Page~~
1. Create a component in /app/personal/spreads to that renders a shadcn card component showing a given spread. Eventually, clicking on the spread will open up the page to view or edit the given spread.
	1. The component should accept a prop for whether the spread is a draft or not, in which case it should have a badge indicating that it is a draft.
	2. The component should display the name of the spread along with the date (just MM/DD/YYYY).
2. The spreads page (/app/personal/spreads/page.tsx) should use the `list` query in the spreads table functions to read the 10 most recently created spreads. These should be displayed using the above card component.
3. The spreads page should also read local storage and pull all items with a key matching the pattern `spread-draft-${Date.now()}`. The date.now() value in the key can be parsed to give the date of the spread draft. 
	1. If the draft has no name, then "Untitled Spread" can be used.
	2. These spread drafts should be rendered in a separate section from the spreads taken from the db.
