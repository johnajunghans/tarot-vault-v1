**This rule should be loaded with [mvp-build.md](/mvp-build.md).**
When given a step to work through (i.e. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc), do the following:
1. Devise a plan for completing the step (you will be in Cursor in plan mode)
2. Implement that plan upon user confirmation
	1. Do task
	2. Recommend any immediate user action (things that you, the model, cannot do such as update an environment variable in the convex dashboard)
	3. Create entry in 0.5.2. (Follow example in 0.5.1)
3. Await potential follow-up prompts
	1. If such prompts exist, go back and repeat step 2 (entry in 0.5.2 should be updated rather than a new entry added)
